# Brachistochrone_RL
This repository contains code for solving brachistochronne problemusing reinforcement learning. A detailed post about the project can be found at : - https://medium.com/@aaryanshmohanbansal/solving-brachistochrone-problem-by-reinforcement-learning-16d7d2af2fbe

Requirements:
1. Stable-Baselines3
2. Tensorboard
3. gym
4. numpy
5. matplotlib
6. scipy

<br>In the directory "rl_algorithms" , run ``` python3 barhcistrone_ddpg.py ``` to start training for RL agent. </br>
<br>In the directory "rl_algorithms", run  ``` python3 run_best_model.py ``` to see the plot of best trajectory learnt by RL agent.</br>
